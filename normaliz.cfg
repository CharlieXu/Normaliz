Run tests for arithmetic overflow = NO

***By selecting YES above supplementary tests will be performed, in order to assure that no arithmetic errors do occur.
***This may slow down the computations.

Overflow test modulus  = 10403

***Overflow Test Modulus is an integer used in the arithmetic tests.
***May be some prime number for example.

Lifting bound  = 9000

***Lifting bound is a number used to do a random lifting of the cone.
***Large numbers assure the success of the lifting but may lead to arithmetic overflow

Verbose = NO

***By selecting YES above some control data will be printed on screen.
***It is designed for users who run complex examples and wish to see how far normaliz has come.
***This setting may be overridden by the options given in the command line.
***Option -c in command line <---> setting YES above

Save memory = NO

***By selecting YES above you may speed up some computations.
***This requires however more working memory.
***If you see that your system runs low on memory select NO above.


Computation type = normal

***Controls the computations performed.
***This setting may be overridden by the options given in the command line.
***6  types available : support_hyperplanes  <---> Option -s in command line
