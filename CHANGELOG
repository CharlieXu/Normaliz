# ChangeLog

## [3.0.0] - 2015-09-18
- new, more natural comfortable input syntax (with backward compatibility)
- standardization of output improved, especially for Hilbert series (not backward compatible)
- new computation goals: module generators over original monoid and class group
- Additional input types, in particular generators for lattices; free combination of generators and constraints
- computation goals can be set in the input file
- long options available
- automatic choice of integer type
- improved linear algebra with much better protection against overflows
- reduction of the arithmetical complexity by subdivision of large simplicial cones and bottom decomposition based on SCIP and approximation methods
- improvement of Fourier-Motzkin elimination by ordering the generators
